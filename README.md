# 3D-Procedural-Generation-Processing-Sketch
This is a 3D procedural generation sketch for Processing. It runs pretty slowly at higher resolutions, but good for getting an idea of what the land could look like?

Honestly, I don't know. I made it out of curiousity to see if I could, and I did. I think it generates some nice looking maps for what it is. There are instructions on what to change in the comments of the sketch.

You will need to have Processing to run the sketches, and just make sure that the files are in the same folder otherwise they can't run.

Also, you're going to need to have peasycam installed inside of Processing, which isn't that difficult to do, but is necessary for proper viewing of the map.
